## Motivation
The motivation behind this was to create a platform that helps people find reliable and affordable home care and appliance maintenance services, while also creating employment opportunities for those looking for such jobs. With this application built on Flutter and Firebase, I wanted to simplify the process of hiring service providers and help those in need of work find job opportunities easily. By doing so, I aimed to create a positive impact on both service providers and users, and contribute to the growth of the local economy.
